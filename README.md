Offensive security writeups and notes.
Built in silence. Proven in execution.

** Purpose **
Silent Forge exists to build real offensive security capability through
consistent hands-on practice, documentation, and reflection.

This repository is a proof-of-work log, not a tutorial collection.

** What You'll Find **
- Notes and writeups
- VM exploitation writeups
- Lessons learned, mistakes, and pivots

** Operating Principles **
- Consistency over intensity
- Understanding over completion
- Documentation as proof
- No walkthrough copying

Progress is measured daily.
